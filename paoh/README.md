## Node-link visualization
Vistorian's node-link visualization has been integrated in the project.
By default it loads the test data called `demo_scientists`.
In order to correctly load data node-link requires in the url
the parameters of session and datasetName on url as follows:

`tvgv.html?session=0&datasetName=demo_scientists`

## TODO
- Connect the node-link visualization to paovis database.
